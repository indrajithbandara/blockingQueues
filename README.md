Blocking Queues
---
Blocking Queues provides some simple, performant, goroutine safe queues useful as resource pools or job queues. 
The primary focus is simplicity and high performance without sacrificing readability. In fact I tried to
provide good documentation on the code and some examples of usage.


## Queues Provided
* **ArrayBlockingQueue**: A bounded blocking queue backed by a slice
* **LinkedBlockingQueue**: A bounded blocking queue backed by a container/list

## Installation
```go
go get -u github.com/theodesp/blockingQueues
```

## Usage

## Benchmarks
Using:
  ```text
  Model Name:	MacBook Pro
